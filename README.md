# Stone_Paper_Scissor
# The simple Stone paper scissor game created using python
Firstly i have created a function in which, i have generate a random number from [-1,0,1] and takes input from user then create two dictionary dic and reverse_dic.
dic refer to random number and reverse_dic refer to user.
In dic i have enter the random number as a key and there valuse are stone paper and scissor and vice versa in reverse_dic.
After that i have create a variable for user as you and print both user and computer generated turns.
Then i have use if elif else statement and check the conditions for win and lose and print the result.
lastly i called the fuction 


# The file clone.py is the same code but a slight difference is of pattern i have used the pattern of computer_generated_no-user_enter_no.
